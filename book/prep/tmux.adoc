== Install tmux

As a Code Mage, your ability to manage multiple spells (commands) simultaneously is critical. Enter **tmux**, the terminal multiplexerâ€”a powerful tool for organizing and navigating your terminal sessions like a true master. Think of tmux as a portal that splits your  into multiple panes and windows, each capable of running its own spell. In this section, you'll learn why tmux is essential and how to set it up with a configuration designed for optimal efficiency.

=== Why tmux?

- **Multitasking Made Easy**: tmux allows you to split your terminal into multiple panes, making it easier to monitor and manage simultaneous tasks.
- **Session Persistence**: Forget losing work due to a dropped connection. tmux keeps your sessions alive even when your terminal closes.
- **Customizable Interface**: With tmux, you can tailor your workspace with custom keybindings, colors, and layouts to match your workflow.
- **Efficiency Boost**: Navigate, resize, and manage panes with simple keyboard shortcuts, reducing the need to switch between multiple terminal tabs or windows.

=== Installing tmux

==== For Mac

If you're using Mac with Homebrew installed, run the following spell to install tmux:
[source,shell]
----
brew install tmux
----

==== For Windows

On Windows, you can install tmux using `winget`:
[source,shell]
----
winget install --id tmux.tmux
----

==== Verify the installation

Confirm tmux is installed by running:
[source,shell]
----
tmux -V
----

If you see the version number, your command portal is ready!

=== Configuring tmux

To maximize the power of tmux, use the following custom configuration file. Don't worry about understanding anything that is in it. You'll have plenty of time to learn all about tmux usage and configuration later. For now just save it as `.tmux.conf` (don't forget the dot) in your home directory (commonly written as `~/.tmux.conf`) using whatever text editor you have:

[source,tmux,linenums]

# change default meta key to same as screen
unbind C-b
unbind C-a
set -g prefix C-a

# turn pane sync on/off
bind -r y setw synchronize-panes

# reload configuration
bind -r r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; display "Config reloaded"

# add double-tap meta key to toggle last window
bind-key C-a last-window

# use a different prefix for nested
bind-key -n C-y send-prefix

# create more intuitive split key combos (same as modern screen)
unbind |
bind | split-window -h
bind '\' split-window -h
bind 'C-\' split-window -h
unbind -
bind - split-window -v
unbind _
bind _ split-window -v

# kill current window and all panes
bind-key & kill-window

# vi for copy mode
setw -g mode-keys vi

# vi for command status
set -g status-keys vi

# vi keys to resize

bind -r C-h resize-pane -L 1
bind -r C-l resize-pane -R 1

# vi keys to navigate panes
bind -r k select-pane -U

set -g base-index 1
setw -g pane-base-index 1

# color the pane borders nearly invisible
# (when not using hacked tmux without them)
set -g pane-border-style "fg=#171717"
set -g pane-active-border-style "fg=#171717"

# color of the window selection background
set -g mode-style "bg=black"

# when status bar is displayed
set -g status-style "fg=#665c54"
set -g status-bg default
set -g status-position top
set -g status-interval 1
set -g status-left ""

# disable status bar (prefer index)
set -g status off
set -g window-status-current-format ""

# start with 1
set -g base-index 1
set -g pane-base-index 1

set -g message-style "fg=red"

# better window names

=== Activate your tmux configuration

Once the configuration file is in place, reload it with the following command:
[source,shell]
