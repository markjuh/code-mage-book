== Opening a command portal

Creating a robust and visually appealing command portal requires tools that blend style, speed, and functionality. This section guides you through installing and configuring Alacritty with the Gruvbox-Material theme and Git Bash. Instructions are provided for both Windows and Mac.

=== Step 1: Installing Alacritty

Alacritty is a lightweight, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator known for its speed and simplicity. Follow the instructions for your platform:

==== Windows

Download the latest Alacritty release from the official repository:  
https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases

Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a directory of your choice (e.g., `C:\Alacritty`).

Add Alacritty to your system's PATH. Open the Start Menu and search for `Environment Variables`. Click on `Edit the system environment variables`. In the System Properties dialog, click on the `Environment Variables` button. Under `System variables`, find and select the `Path` variable, then click `Edit`. Add the directory containing `alacritty.exe` to the list (e.g., `C:\Alacritty`).

To open the built-in terminal, press `Win + R`, type `cmd` or `powershell`, and press `Enter`.

Test the installation by typing `alacritty` in the terminal. If the terminal opens, the installation was successful.

==== Mac

Install Homebrew (if not already installed) by opening the terminal. To open the built-in terminal on Mac, press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, and press `Enter`. Alternatively, you can find Terminal in `Applications -> Utilities`.

Run the following command to install Homebrew:
[source,shell]
----
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
----
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. After installation, verify that Homebrew is installed:
[source,shell]
----
brew --version
----

Use Homebrew to install Alacritty:
[source,shell]
----
brew install alacritty
----

Verify the installation by typing `alacritty` in the terminal. If the terminal opens, the installation was successful.

=== Step 2: Applying configuration

To ensure your Alacritty setup is fully optimized, copy the following configuration into your `alacritty.toml` file. This file is used to customize the appearance and behavior of Alacritty.

==== All platforms

Open or create the Alacritty configuration file at:

- `%APPDATA%\alacritty\alacritty.toml` for Windows.
- `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml` for Mac or Linux.

Replace the contents of the file with the following configuration:

[source,toml]
----
[general]
live_config_reload = true

[font]
size = 36

[font.bold]
family = "UbuntuMono Nerd Font"
style = "Bold"

[font.bold_italic]
family = "UbuntuMono Nerd Font"
style = "Bold Italic"

[font.italic]
family = "UbuntuMono Nerd Font"
style = "Italic"

[font.normal]
family = "UbuntuMono Nerd Font"
style = "Regular"

[window.padding]
x = 8
y = 8

[colors.bright]
black = "0x3c3836"
blue = "0x7daea3"
cyan = "0x89b482"
green = "0xa9b665"
magenta = "0xd3869b"
red = "0xea6962"
white = "0xd4be98"
yellow = "0xd8a657"

[colors.normal]
black = "0x3c3836"
blue = "0x7daea3"
cyan = "0x89b482"
green = "0xa9b665"
magenta = "0xd3869b"
red = "0xea6962"
white = "0xd4be98"
yellow = "0xd8a657"

[colors.primary]
background = "0x282828"
foreground = "0xd4be98"

----

Save the file and restart Alacritty to apply the configuration.

=== Step 3: Setting up Git Bash

If youâ€™re on Windows, Git Bash provides a Unix-like environment:

==== Windows

Download Git for Windows from:  
https://git-scm.com/

Install Git Bash by running the downloaded installer. During installation, select "Git Bash Here" as an option for easy access. Choose a preferred editor (optional) and complete the setup.

Use Git Bash as a shell in Alacritty. Open `%APPDATA%\alacritty\alacritty.toml` and add the following shell configuration:

[source,shell]
----
[shell]
program = "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"
----

Replace the path with the correct location of your `bash.exe` if necessary.

Test your setup by launching Alacritty and verifying that Git Bash starts as the default shell.

==== Mac

Git Bash is not needed for Mac, as Mac includes a Unix-like shell (Zsh or Bash) by default. You can simply use the built-in terminal functionality with Alacritty.

---

Congratulations! You now have a sleek and powerful command portal, combining Alacritty's speed, the aesthetic brilliance of your custom configuration, and the versatility of your preferred shell.
