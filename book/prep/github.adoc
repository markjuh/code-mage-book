== Crafting your code book of spells

Every wizard needs a spellbook, and as a modern-day coder, your GitHub repository is your magical **Code Book of Spells**. In this section, we’ll assemble your GitHub account, seek guidance from the `gh` oracle to connect your command line with GitHub’s vast knowledge, and inscribe your first repository.

=== Step 1: Create GitHub account

The first step to crafting your spellbook is binding its cover—creating your GitHub account:

1. Open the workshop portal to GitHub:  
   https://github.com/

2. Click on the **Sign up** button to start creating your account.

3. Fill in your **email address**, **username**, and a secure **password**. These are your credentials for accessing the oracle, so choose wisely. Pick a good lowercase name that is easy to type and remember, people far and wide will come to know you by your new mage username.

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to verify your account, including solving a CAPTCHA and checking your email for a verification link.

5. Once your account is created, log in to GitHub. Congratulations—you’ve completed the binding of your spellbook’s cover!

=== Step 2: Install `gh` tool

The `gh` command-line tool acts as your oracle, connecting your terminal directly to GitHub’s wisdom.

==== Mac

Open your terminal (press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, and press `Enter`) and run the following command:
[source,shell]
----
brew install gh
----

==== Windows

Open PowerShell or Git Bash by pressing `Win + R`, typing `powershell` or `bash`, and pressing `Enter`. Then, run the following command:
[source,shell]
----
winget install --id GitHub.cli
----

You could also do this from your newly configured Alacritty terminal.

Verify the installation by consulting the oracle:
[source,shell]
----
gh --version
----

If the version information appears, your oracle is ready to guide you!

=== Step 3: Authenticate with GitHub

To connect your oracle to GitHub, authenticate it with your account:

Run the following command:
[source,shell]
----
gh auth login
----

Follow the prompts:
1. Select **GitHub.com** as the host.
2. Choose **HTTPS** for authentication.
3. When prompted, authorize `gh` to access your account by opening the provided link in your browser and entering the one-time code.

Confirm your connection to the oracle:
[source,shell]
----
gh auth status
----

If the oracle acknowledges you, the binding is complete!

=== Step 4: Create a repository

With the oracle’s guidance, create your first repository:

Run the following command:
[source,shell]
----
gh repo create codebook --public --clone
----

This will:
- Create a repository named `codebook` on GitHub.
- Clone it to your current directory, creating a local repository.

Navigate to your new repository:
[source,shell]
----
cd codebook
----

=== Step 5: Add a file

Create a `README.md` file in which to take notes. For example:
[source,shell]
----
echo "# My Codebook" > README.md
----

Stage the file:
[source,shell]
----
git add README.md
----

Commit the file with a descriptive message:
[source,shell]
----
git commit -m "Added README.md"
----

Push your spell to GitHub:
[source,shell]
----
git push origin main
----

Visit your GitHub repository online to see your spell safely inscribed!

=== Step 6: Future revisions

Now that your spellbook is ready, you can:
- Consult the oracle to pull down new spells:
[source,shell]
----
git pull
----
- Add and commit your latest enchantments using Git and the oracle.

Congratulations, scribe! You’ve crafted your first GitHub repository and inscribed your first spell. Your **Code Book of Spells** is now enriched with the guidance of the `gh` oracle.
