== Running code-mage init

Now that Go and `code-mage` (`cm`) have been installed on your computer. You can use them to assist with setting up the rest of your personal development environment or PDE. Mages call setting something up `initialization`.

Running `code-mage init` (or `cm init`) does the following setup work for you so you don't have to, for now:

- Provide `cm` cheat sheet filling one screen with only essentials
- Set up your software installer (`brew`, `winget`, `apt`, etc.)
- Install the best terminal for your computer (usually Alacritty)
- Configure terminal to use gruvbox-material colors and bash shell
- Install latest bash shell
- Provide `cm learn bash` interactive guide
- Configure bash with common preferences
- Install vim or neovim (nvim) depending on your computer
- Configure vim/nvim for coding Go, bash, python, html, css, javascript
- Provide `cm learn vim` interactive guide
- Install tmux terminal multiplexer to super-charge your terminal
