== Installing a crafting table

Every magical sanctum needs a crafting table—a central place where spells are mixed, potions brewed, and artifacts assembled. For your coding sanctum, **Podman** serves as this vital crafting table, allowing you to create, manage, and run containerized enchantments.

=== Step 1: Install Podman

==== Mac

Begin by opening your terminal (press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, and press `Enter`). Run the following incantation to install Podman via Homebrew:
[source,shell]
----
brew install podman
----

Once installed, initialize Podman with:
[source,shell]
----
podman machine init
podman machine start
----

==== Windows

Open PowerShell or Git Bash by pressing `Win + R`, typing `powershell` or `bash`, and pressing `Enter`. Summon Podman using the following command:
[source,shell]
----
winget install --id RedHat.Podman
----

You could also use Alacritty for this.

After installation, start your Podman machine:
[source,shell]
----
podman machine init
podman machine start
----

Verify that your crafting table is ready with:
[source,shell]
----
podman --version
----

If the version displays, your magical crafting table is assembled and ready for use!

=== Step 2: Configure Podman

To ensure your crafting table is fully operational, configure your workspace:

For all platforms, enable rootless mode for better security:
[source,shell]
----
podman info
----

Review the output to confirm that the storage and network details match your needs.

=== Step 3: Run a container

Try creating a simple container to ensure the crafting table works. Cast the following spell to summon an ephemeral container running Nginx:
[source,shell]
----
podman run --rm -d -p 8080:80 nginx
----

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. If the Nginx welcome page appears, your crafting table is ready to conjure powerful spells!

Stop the container with:
[source,shell]
----
podman stop $(podman ps -q)
----

=== Step 4: Expand your magical tools

With Podman as your crafting table, you can:
- Conjure container images with:
[source,shell]
----
podman build -t my-spellbook .
----
- Summon existing containers with:
[source,shell]
----
podman pull ubuntu
----

Congratulations! You’ve established the heart of your magical sanctum. With Podman as your crafting table, you’re ready to create and manage containerized spells.
