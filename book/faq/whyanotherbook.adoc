== Why another Go book?

Almost all existing books covering Go suffer from one of the following failures:

- Contain incorrect or out of date material
- To serious to be memorable or fun
- Assume "some programming" knowledge already
- Say nothing about how to setup a personal development environment
- Do not use the terminal except to compile
- Have no community associated with them for support
- Pick poor project ideas that are easily forgotten
- No accompanying app and command line assistant

Not every author is willing to publish a $40 book claiming to cover generics and only have a proposed specification proving to be absolutely wrong then later charged another $40 for the "updated" version of the book. Not every publisher is generally as inept and irresponsible as Packt Publishing. Most books are written by great people who have put a lot of work into them. I get it. I just wanted something more and was tired of waiting.
