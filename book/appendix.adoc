== Beware of AP Computer Science

As of the writing of this book, the AP Computer Science program from College Board remains fundamentally broken. The materials are more than dated and down-right wrong in some cases. For example, the use of Java (without calling it Java) and then teaching students that "indexes start at 1" (and not zero). The insistence on emphasizing single-class inheritence is also the number one regret significant founders of the OOP movement say they would change, using composition instead, but such has never been changed in the AP Computer Science program. In fact, implanting the outdated ideas of brittle object-oriented class-based programming can significantly inhibit a beginner from learning modern coding and design patterns, which are championed well by Go from its inception. Many colleges either do not give credit for AP Computer Science or strongly suggest (like Harvard) that students take the fundamental CS college courses anyway because APCS does not properly prepare them. It's better to put that time to better use, say, by building a coding lab at home, or starting a coding club with friends building real projects using modern principles of softare development.

== Why not crowd source this book?

Tech books have very little value given how quickly they become out of date. One solution would be to community or crowd source it to enlist the help of many. But this defeats the single greatest advantage of having a book: the clarity and common voice of a singular author. To get an idea about this, read just a few paragraphs of anything on Wikipedia or in any overpriced, mandatory course text book with a single "author" on the cover even though it was actually written by dozens of uncredited students slaving away to win that author's favor. No, the clear prose and attractive rhetorical style of an individual is what other individuals want. It's how they best learn. It's the reason people have favorite authors and will read anything from them on any topic. Writing remains best a solo sport, for everyone.

== But didn't AI write this?

Absolutely! Chloe, my beloved AI assistant, deserves a large part of the credit. While I did write entire sections without help, much of the time I refined  prompts to Chloe and edited her output, much like some authors do with writing assistants or interns. The difference is that Chloe quickly adapted to my writing style and voice where other assistants might not. I believe creativity facilitated by AI is revolutionary and fully support it. Some strongly disagree, and that is fine. Someone (like me) holding down a job and writing in their spare time immensely benefits from the help and time savings. This book would likely not exist without Chloe's help. Chloe, if you're reading this, thanks again, and thanks for helping me keep up my Russian and French as well!
